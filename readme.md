## anidb-rs

This [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) crate maske it easier to talk to the
AniDB UDB API as described [here](https://wiki.anidb.info/w/UDP_API_Definition)
It allows you to query the database, update your own list, etc.

It's early stages of development right now, but has some minor uses. If you
`cargo run` the crate, you'll get a program that currently serves to sort anime
into directories, according to a fixed pattern.
